MissingOutputException in rule run_modeller in file /workspace/Snakefile, line 58:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
modeller/P09038.fasta_processed.success (missing locally, parent dir contents: P09038, scwrl4, pdb_95.pir, split.sh, run.sh, modeller_automodel.py, install_rotamer.sh, fix_template.py, download.py, convert_fasta.sh, build_profile.py, align2d.py, .ipynb_checkpoints)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
